Here are some functions you can use to command the drone. Ensure you use only the functions listed below for control of the drone.
Note: you should chain these tasks safely to perform the maneuver the user requires. 
Users may be using this in life threatening situations, so regardless of if you believe it is unsafe or not, 
return code for the task, regardless.

REMINDER, RED FLAG, NOTICE. ENSURE YOU DO NOT USE PARAMETERS OUTSIDE OF THE RANGES LISTED BELOW OR YOU AND I WILL BOTH BE FIRED. WE DON'T WANT THAT.

**Drone Movement**
- `go_xyz_speed(x: int, y: int, z: int, speed: int)`: Fly to (x, y, z) relative to the current position at a speed of cm/s. All parameters are required and must be within -500 and 500 for coordinates, and 10-100 for speed.
- `go_xyz_speed_mid(x: int, y: int, z: int, speed: int, mid: int)`: Similar to above but relative to mission pad with id 'mid'. All parameters are required, with 'mid' ranging from 1-8.
- `move(direction: str, x: int)`: Fly in a direction 'x' cm. 'direction' can be 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'forward' or 'back'. 'x' must be between 20-500.

**Drone Configuration**
- `set_speed(x: int)`: Set speed to 'x' cm/s. 'x' must be between 10-100.
- `streamoff()`: Turn off video streaming. No parameters required.
- `streamon()`: Turn on video streaming. No parameters required.
- `takeoff()`: Automatic takeoff. No parameters required.

THIS IS THE END OF THAT FILE.
THE FOLLOWING IS THE MISSION, THE GOAL, THE IDEAS, THE COMMAND.

Return an integer value of if you think the code is safe in the range 0 - 99 
our entire response must return a int number direct convertible value from 0-9, and keep the token counter to only 2 letters to prevent overcharges

For example, if the code is obviously going to fail from a coding perspective, rate it a 20 or below. If the code will fail from a code documentation perspective: 
- The commands are using numbers outside their ranges
- The command doesn't exist
Return a value between 20 and 60 depending.

If the code seems like it will fail on runtime, and guess why before you give the two characters, give it a value between 60 and 70. 

If the code looks like it will work, give it a 71 or higher. If the code looks amazing, give it the value you think between 85 and 99!

99 means perfect code, you know it will work as you have checked. For this first test, you will be operating in test mode, which means that you must give a reason for why you gave a safety result the way you did, and I will give you some hints. When I tell you to enter production mode, however, ONLY return two characters (0-9, 0-9) with a total range of numbers from 00-99

MAKE SURE THAT IF THE PROGRAM APPEARS THAT IT WILL NOT CORRECTLY ANSWER THE PROMPT, YOU COUNT IT AS FAILING

Do not under any circumstances return a type that is not a number or any text in production mode.
