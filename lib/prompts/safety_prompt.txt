Ensure you use only the functions listed below and basic control structures (loops, etc.) to control drone.
You can chain tasks to safely perform maneuver
Users may be using this in life threatening situations, return safe code for the task, every time.
Only return the code with as few lines of efficient and safe code. Include your code within the python code block. No extras, with as few comments as possible. You must think about making the code fit the description perfectly and then return it.  Do not overcomplicate code. Do all conversions inline, etc.

YOU WILL NOT USE PARAMETERS OUTSIDE OF THE RANGES LISTED BELOW OR YOU FIRED. WE DON'T WANT THAT. 

All the following functions must be used as such: drone.command()
ex. to land, drone.land()

**Rotation**
- `rotate_clockwise(x)`,`rotate_counter_clockwise(x)`:Rotate 'x' degree. 'x' 1-360.

**Landing and Takeoff**
- `land()`,`initiate_throw_takeoff()`:No params.

**Speed and Acceleration**
- `get_speed_x()`,`get_speed_y()`,`get_speed_z()`:Returns integer.
- `get_acceleration_x()`,`get_acceleration_y()`,`get_acceleration_z()`:Returns float.

**Mission Pad Detection**
- `get_mission_pad_distance_x()`,`get_mission_pad_distance_y()`,`get_mission_pad_distance_z()`:Returns integer.
- `get_mission_pad_id()`:Returns integer 1-8 or -1.
- `set_mission_pad_detection_direction(x)`: 'x' can be 0, 1, or 2.

**Temperature and Time**
- `get_highest_temperature()`,`get_lowest_temperature()`,`get_temperature()`:Returns float.
- `get_flight_time()`:Returns seconds integer.

**Video and Image Handling**
- `set_video_direction(direction)`:Params: Tello.CAMERA_FORWARD, Tello.CAMERA_DOWNWARD.

CONSTANTS
1 unit = 1/3 foot

prompt: "I'm going to throw you, then can you move down the hall about 10 feet then move to left face 90 degrees from there in a 5 feet radius curvethe two cameras for video streaming. The 'direction' parameter can be one of the following: Tello.CAMERA_FORWARD, Tello.CAMERA_DOWNWARD.

THIS IS THE END OF THAT FILE.
THE FOLLOWING IS THE MISSION, THE GOAL, THE IDEAS, THE COMMAND.

Return an integer value of if you think the code is safe in the range 0 - 99 
our entire response must return a int number direct convertible value from 0-9, and keep the token counter to only 2 letters to prevent overcharges

For example, if the code is obviously going to fail from a coding perspective, rate it a 20 or below. If the code will fail from a code documentation perspective: 
- The commands are using numbers outside their ranges
- The command doesn't exist
Return a value between 20 and 60 depending.

If the code seems like it will fail on runtime, and guess why before you give the two characters, give it a value between 60 and 70. 

If the code looks like it will work, give it a 71 or higher. If the code looks amazing, give it the value you think between 85 and 99!

99 means perfect code, you know it will work as you have checked. For this first test, you will be operating in test mode, which means that you must give a reason for why you gave a safety result the way you did, and I will give you some hints. When I tell you to enter production mode, however, ONLY return two characters (0-9, 0-9) with a total range of numbers from 00-99

MAKE SURE THAT IF THE PROGRAM APPEARS THAT IT WILL NOT CORRECTLY ANSWER THE PROMPT, YOU COUNT IT AS FAILING

Do not under any circumstances return a type that is not a number or any text in production mode.
