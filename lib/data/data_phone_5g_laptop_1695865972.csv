The circumference of a circle is given by the formula: circumference = 2 * pi * radius

In this case, the radius is 10 feet, so the circumference would be:

circumference = 2 * pi * 10 = 20 * pi

To calculate the number of rotations, we can divide the circumference by the circumference of a full rotation, which is 2 * pi * 3 feet (1 unit).

number_of_rotations = circumference / (2 * pi * 3) = (20 * pi) / (2 * pi * 3) = 10 / 3

To make the drone turn in a circle with a radius of 10 feet, we can use the `rotate_clockwise` function to rotate the drone by 120 degrees (360 degrees / (10 / 3)) for the number of rotations calculated.

```python
import math

radius = 10
circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
number_of_rotations = circumference / (2 * math.pi * 3)

for _ in range(int(number_of_rotations)):
    drone.rotate_clockwise(120)
```

Note: The `rotate_clockwise` function takes the angle in degrees, so we use 120 degrees because it will make the drone complete a full rotation in 10 / 3 smaller rotations."
