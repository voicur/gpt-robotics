gpt-3.5-turbo-16k,6.28,1.7252588272094727,8.01,60,"To turn in a circle with a radius of 10 feet, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle and then divide it by the number of sides of the polygon that approximates the circle. Let's assume we want to approximate the circle with 360 sides (which will give us a smooth circle). Here's the code:

```python
import math

radius = 10  # radius in feet

circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius  # calculate the circumference of the circle
side_length = circumference / 360  # calculate the side length of the polygon

for _ in range(360):
    drone.move_forward(int(side_length))
    drone.rotate_counter_clockwise(1)
```

Note that the `move_forward` function takes an integer value, so we need to convert the `side_length` to an integer before passing it as an argument."
